 # Homework problem 

## Problem statment
 Update our current API by introducing two new functionalities. Utilize the existing `ProductModel`:

1. Implement a feature to delete a product. This function should take the ID of the product to be deleted as input.
2. Introduce a feature to update a product. This functionality should accept the ID of the product and the keys in the `req.body` that need to be updated. Ensure the ability to modify the product accordingly.

Consider the appropriate route, HTTP method, and logic required to implement these features.
