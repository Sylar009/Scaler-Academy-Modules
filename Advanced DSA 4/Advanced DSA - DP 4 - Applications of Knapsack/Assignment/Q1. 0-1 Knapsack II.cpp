/*
Problem Description

Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.

Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.

Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.

NOTE: You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).



Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 500

1 <= C, B[i] <= 106

1 <= A[i] <= 50



Input Format

First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.

Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.

Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.



Output Format

Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [6, 10, 12]
 B = [10, 20, 30]
 C = 50
Input 2:

 A = [1, 3, 2, 4]
 B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
 C = 10


Example Output

Output 1:

 22
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 10 + 12 = 22
Explanation 2:

 Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be considered in the knapsack therefore answer is 0.
