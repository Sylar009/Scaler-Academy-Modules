/*
Problem Description

You have a string, denoted as A.

To transform the string, you should perform the following operation repeatedly:
Identify the first occurrence of consecutive identical pairs of characters within the string.
Remove this pair of identical characters from the string.
Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there are no more consecutive identical pairs of characters.
The final result will be the transformed string.


Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 100000



Input Format

First and only argument is string A.



Output Format

Return the final string.



Example Input

Input 1:


 A = "abccbc"

Input 2:


 A = "ab"



Example Output

Output 1:

 "ac"
Output 2:

 "ab"


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

The Given string is "abccbc".

Remove the first occurrence of consecutive identical pairs of characters "cc".
After removing the string will be "abbc".

Again Removing the first occurrence of consecutive identical pairs of characters "bb".
After remvoing, the string will be "ac".

Now, there is no consecutive identical pairs of characters.
Therefore the string after this operation will be "ac".
Explanation 2:

 No removals are to be done.

string Solution::solve(string A) {
    stack<char> st;

    for (int i = A.size()-1; i >=0; i--) {
        if (st.empty()) {
            st.push(A[i]);
        }
        else {
            if (A[i] == st.top()) st.pop();
            else st.push(A[i]);
        }
    }

    string res = "";
    while (!st.empty()) {
        res += st.top();
        st.pop();
    }

    return res;
